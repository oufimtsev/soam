                A product (project or program) succeeds when it satisfies the objectives of its stakeholders. Understanding who
                stakeholders are and what their objectives are is the bedrock on which a successful product is built. Our
                Stakeholder & Objective Analysis and Management (SOAM) tool makes it faster and easier for users to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify, understand, and document:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stakeholders</li>
                        <li>Stakeholder objectives,</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Find and resolve conflicts between them,</li>
                    <li>Develop a communications plan, and</li>
                    <li>Engage stakeholders.</li>
